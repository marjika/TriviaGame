# TriviaGame
This repository is for a Javascript game, using Jquery Bootstrap styling, including radio buttons, constructors, modals and setInterval functionality. The game contains a Javascript file to run the game, an html and css file, and images used in the game.  The styling is created through the use of bootstrap, a css file, and within the html file.  
The game is a tivia game with both the look and questions employing a piano theme.  It consists of ten questions, displayed one at a time; each one must be answered in 25 seconds.
